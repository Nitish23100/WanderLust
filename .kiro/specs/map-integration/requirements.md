# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate an interactive map into the Wanderlust application to display the geographical location of hotel listings. The map will be positioned above the reviews section on the listing detail page (show.ejs) and will help users visualize where the property is located before making a booking decision.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing hotel listings, I want to see an interactive map showing the exact location of the property, so that I can understand the geographical context and proximity to landmarks or areas of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a listing detail page THEN the system SHALL display an interactive map above the reviews section
2. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL show a marker at the exact location of the listing
3. WHEN the user interacts with the map THEN the system SHALL allow zooming, panning, and standard map controls
4. IF the listing has valid location data THEN the system SHALL center the map on the property location
5. WHEN the map marker is clicked THEN the system SHALL display a popup with the listing title and location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a property owner adding a new listing, I want the system to capture accurate location coordinates, so that guests can find my property easily on the map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing a listing THEN the system SHALL provide a way to set geographical coordinates
2. WHEN a user enters a location/address THEN the system SHALL attempt to geocode it to latitude/longitude coordinates
3. IF geocoding fails THEN the system SHALL allow manual coordinate entry or map-based selection
4. WHEN coordinates are set THEN the system SHALL validate they are within reasonable geographical bounds
5. WHEN saving a listing THEN the system SHALL store both the address string and coordinates in the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on a mobile device, I want the map to be responsive and touch-friendly, so that I can easily explore the location on my phone or tablet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the listing page on mobile THEN the map SHALL be responsive and fit the screen width
2. WHEN using touch gestures THEN the map SHALL support pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-pan
3. WHEN the map loads on mobile THEN the system SHALL use appropriate zoom levels for mobile viewing
4. IF the device has GPS capability THEN the system SHALL optionally show user's current location relative to the listing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the map to load quickly and not impact page performance, so that I can view listing details without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the listing page loads THEN the map SHALL load asynchronously without blocking other content
2. WHEN map resources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message or static map
3. WHEN the map fails to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without breaking the page layout
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the map SHALL appear within 3 seconds on standard internet connections
5. IF the listing has no coordinates THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating location is not available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure map settings and API keys securely, so that the mapping service works reliably across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the map service THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for API keys and sensitive configuration
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that required map configuration is present
3. IF API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully
4. WHEN map errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information for debugging
5. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for configuration issues
